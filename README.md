## Daniel Miao, 04/08/2020

There are 7 directories which covers different topics using terraform.
Navigate to each directory, running "terraform init" to install aws plugin, then run "terraform plan" to check syntax and deploy it using "terrafrom apply".  After finished, run "terraform destroy" to clean up aws resources.
